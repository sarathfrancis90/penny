## üîê Admin Access

The Admin Console is a **hidden administrative interface** for managing users, monitoring system analytics, and controlling the application. It is not linked from the main application for security purposes.

### Access Information

**URL:** `/admin-console`  
**Login URL:** `/admin-console/login`

### Default Credentials

```

```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Change these credentials in production by setting environment variables:
> - `ADMIN_USERNAME` - Your custom admin username
> - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Your custom secure password
> - `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` - Secret key for session encryption

## üìä Features

### Overview Cards

The admin dashboard shows 4 key metrics at the top:
1. **Total Users** - Number of registered users (with count of users who have expenses)
2. **API Requests** - Total AI requests made (last 30 days)
3. **Total Cost** - Estimated total cost in USD
4. **Success Rate** - Percentage of successful API requests

### 1. User Management

**View All Users (from Firebase Auth):**
- Shows **ALL registered users**, even those who haven't added any expenses yet
- User display name and email (fetched from Firebase Authentication)
- Email verification status (verified/unverified indicator)
- Account status (Active/Disabled)
- User ID (truncated for display)
- Registration date (when account was created)
- Last sign-in time
- Last activity (latest of: last login or last expense)
- Total number of expenses
- Total amount spent

**Search & Filter:**
- Real-time search by email, display name, or user ID
- Shows filtered count vs total users
- Instant results as you type

**User Actions:**
- **Export User Data** - Downloads complete JSON export of user profile, expenses, and analytics
- **Reset Expenses** - Deletes all expenses for a user (preserves analytics)
  - Disabled for users with zero expenses
- **Delete User** - Completely removes all user data including expenses and analytics
- All destructive actions require confirmation dialog

**Data Retention:**
- Users remain visible in the admin console even after resetting all expenses
- This allows tracking of registered users who haven't added data yet
- Admin can see inactive accounts and users who are just getting started

### 2. Analytics Dashboard

**Summary Statistics (Last 30 days):**
- Total API requests
- Success rate
- Average response duration
- Total tokens consumed
- Estimated costs (USD)
- Failed request count

**Request Distribution:**
- By user (top 10 users by API usage)
- By date (time series data)
- By type (text vs. image requests)

**User Analytics:**
- Individual user request counts
- Token consumption per user
- Cost breakdown per user
- Success rate per user

### 3. API Usage Tracking

The system automatically tracks:
- Every expense analysis request
- Request type (text or image)
- Response time/duration
- Success/failure status
- Estimated token usage
- Estimated cost (based on Gemini pricing)

**Pricing Estimates:**
- Gemini 2.0 Flash model
- ~$0.075 per 1M input tokens
- ~$0.30 per 1M output tokens

### 4. System Information

- View admin credentials
- Quick access to system stats
- Refresh data functionality
- Secure logout

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Authentication System

```typescript
/src/lib/admin-auth.ts
```

**Features:**
- Session-based authentication with HMAC signatures
- 24-hour session expiration
- HttpOnly, Secure cookies
- Brute force protection (1-second delay on failed login)

### API Endpoints

**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/admin/auth` - Admin login
- `GET /api/admin/auth` - Check session
- `DELETE /api/admin/auth` - Logout

**User Management:**
- `GET /api/admin/users` - List **ALL registered users** from Firebase Auth + expense data
  - Returns: `users[]`, `totalUsers`, `registeredUsers`, `usersWithExpenses`
  - Merges Firebase Auth data with expense aggregations
  - Shows users even if they have zero expenses
- `GET /api/admin/users/[userId]/export` - Export complete user data as JSON
  - Returns: user profile, expenses, analytics, summary statistics
  - Useful for GDPR compliance and data portability
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/[userId]?type=expenses` - Reset user expenses only
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/[userId]?type=all` - Delete all user data (expenses + analytics)

**Analytics:**
- `GET /api/admin/analytics?days=30` - Get analytics for specified period
  - Returns: summary stats, user breakdown, daily breakdown, type breakdown

### Database Collections

**1. Analytics Collection (`analytics`)**
```typescript
{
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  userId: string,
  requestType: "text" | "image" | "unknown",
  success: boolean,
  duration: number, // milliseconds
  estimatedTokens: number,
  estimatedCost: number,
  hasImage: boolean,
  error?: string
}
```

**2. Expenses Collection (`expenses`)**
- Standard user expense data
- Tracked per user with userId field

**3. Offline Expenses (`offlineExpenses`)**
- Queued expenses for offline sync
- Can be deleted during user cleanup
