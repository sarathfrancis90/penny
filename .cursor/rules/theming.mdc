**Goal**
- Use a **single, centralized theme system** (design tokens for colors, spacing, typography) for pages, modals, and components.


**Rules**
- All colors, spacing, radii, and typography come from **tokens** (e.g., Tailwind config, CSS variables, or a ThemeProvider).
- **Do not** hardcode hex values or ad-hoc styles in components; import from theme utilities.
- Modals/pages consume shared tokens and utility classes; no component-local color definitions.
- Dark mode and brand variants derive from the same token set.


**Implementation Hints**
- Tailwind: define tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` + CSS variables (e.g., `:root { --color-primary: ... }`).
- React: expose a `ThemeProvider` at app root; pages/components read from tokens/hooks only.


**Checklist (Definition of Done)**
- [ ] No hardcoded hex/rgb/hsl in component files.
- [ ] New components import from `theme/` or use Tailwind tokens only.
- [ ] Theming changes are one-file/one-place edits (propagate everywhere).
